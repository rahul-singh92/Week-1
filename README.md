# Week-1
This repository contains how to download datasets from kaggle and how to check the path. We have imported some modules like os for directories, matplotlib.pyplot for playing with images. Then we have used os module to find out the path of the classes with its length and name of each classes. Then we have used pyplot for getting some images.
